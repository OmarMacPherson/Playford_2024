This project was developed for the inaugural North Adelaide 2024 Career Expo, organized by the City of Playford. Designed to streamline the presentation of job opportunities, my role was to automate the gathering, validation, and display of job listings. This effort was in preparation for an event expected to attract 10,000 attendees, aiming to facilitate direct connections between job seekers and employers in the Northern Adelaide area.

# Objective: 

The objective of this project was to automate the management and display of job listings for the North Adelaide 2024 Career Expo, ensuring that all job information was current and accurately presented. My role included developing an automated system to collect and validate job data, alongside creating a dashboard for event organizers. This dashboard tracked key metrics, like the total number of jobs and their distribution by sector, aiding organizers in making informed operational decisions. This setup not only streamlined the presentation process but also enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of the event's logistical operations.
